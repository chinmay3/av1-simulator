# AV1 Simulator — Netflix Demo

This repo hosts the Netflix-style UI that runs the AV1SIM encoder/decoder in real time.

## Run locally

```bash
python app.py
```

Place a `thumbnail.png` image in `static/thumbnail.png` and open `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

Note: the hosted Vercel demo uses a small synthetic sample if `input.yuv` is not present.
